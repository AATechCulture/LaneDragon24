Problem Statement: The misrepresentation and lack of help for the homeless population, as well as the lack of essential resources and support systems, keeping the cycle of homelessness going.

Our project, Finding Home, is a web-based application that focuses on creating a roadmap for our users that are experiencing homelessness. We focus on immediately helping our user find the most suitable shelter using AI, we then try to use the same AI to generate resources that directly align with the users need. Lastly Our application will connect user with individuals that are in the same situation.

Our first and most important value is the importance of sleep, the belief that every individual should have a place to spend the night. Our second value is empathy, We as college student know how hard it is to stay afloat in this day and age, and we want to show that by recognizing that it could just as easily be our reality! Our third and final value is the belief in willpower, with willpower one can accomplish anything and we want to reflect that by encouraging other to get off the ground and try, try again until you make it.
